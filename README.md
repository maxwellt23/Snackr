### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features

Snackr is a simple, lightweight demo recipes app. It features advanced search and filtering capabilites, image caching, a custom pull to refresh implementation and dark mode support. I had a lot of fun working on this project and was able to use the skills I already had and add some new ones to my toolbox.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

I focused mainly on the UI/UX of the app, implementing haptic feedback and making sure that features were easily accessible. This is because personally if an app doesn't look/feel good, or if features are hard to find, I am more likely to stop using the app.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

I spent approximately 5 hours working on this project. My time was allocated as follows:\n
    - 15 minutes were used to connect to the API and display the data using a basic SwiftUI view.\n
    - 2.5 hours were focused on the UI/UX design, making sure the app had a clean and intuitve UI.\n
    - 1.5 hours were spent learning about unit testing and then writing/integrating the tests.\n
    - 45 minutes were dedicated to creating a custom image loading/caching system.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

I don't feel like I had to make any significant trade-offs. I was able to implement every feature I had planned without any major hurdles.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

I would say the weakest part of the app is the RecipeDetailView. I don't love the layout of information. It works, but it could definitely be improved.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

This is the first project in which I have added unit tests. So there was a small learning curve, but I was able to get the hang of it pretty fast. I quickly realized how important unit tests are in development, as I was able to catch and quickly fix several issues that from looking at the code seemed like it would run just fine.
